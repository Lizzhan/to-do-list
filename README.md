# to-do-list

1. Layout:
    a. Kinda looks like OutLook
    b. Days in month calender (will implement later)
    c. Hours in each day

2. Functionalities:
    a. Add, remove task DONE
    b. edit task content 
    c. set priority
    d. reminder - realtime countdown. Set a date and time where the task is due. Everytime the 
    e. when click on individual tasks in the list page, the content of the task will appear 
    f. due date reminder everytime the user opens the page

<!-- click on task (the p tag), adds 'selected' class to p tag.
iterate through the array to find the Task Object with the same name as the p tag's name/text content
then show that Task object's todos in display-task -- DONE -->

!!think through the entire layout first, before coding. It is difficult, but worth it and much better than wasting time on writing codes that won't get used later. 
Use a top-down approach: big picktures first, details later
